//The main purpose of creating this is to have a simple todo list on what needs to be done.

1) Create a completely new design using CSS and HTML using Table's to reach the design that was 
given. 
2) Splice all the components and layers of each element in the .ai files that were given. 
	Note: John you may have to do this in illustrator for me since I'm using Linux. 
	I'll be going into more detail about which layers need to be created for the final design. 
3) Finish the source code and finish what needs to be touched up upon.
